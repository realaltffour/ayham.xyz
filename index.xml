presented here are just ideas and nothing serious.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Beginning of a series!</title><link>https://ayham.xyz/posts/firstpost/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 13:30:24 +0300</pubDate><author>me@ayham.xyz (ayham)</author><guid>https://ayham.xyz/posts/firstpost/</guid><description>The Beginning of a series!
