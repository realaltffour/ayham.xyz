seriously. After contemplation, I realize that the essay itself is not complete
and probably contains linguistic mistakes. However, this is AN attempt at
rationalizing money pursuit. While developing the argument presented here, I had
a debate with a classmate which helped write the intent section. All ideas
presented here are just ideas and nothing serious.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
